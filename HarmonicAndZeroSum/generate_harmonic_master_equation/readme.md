good simple implementation of pure normal form game framework, lightweight, based on dictionaries. 

1. given game checkes whether game is strategically equivalent to weighted zero sum and finds such weighted zero-sum game
2. given game checks whether game is strategically equivalent to (generalised) harmonic game and finds such generalized harmonic game
3. given measure generates (generalised) harmonic game
4. given game and measure checks whether game is harmonic wrt said measure

Base on master harmonic equation, completely independent from Hodge combinatorial origin
